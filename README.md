# Bayesian-Inference-Analysis-for-Marketing-Campaign-Effectiveness
Analyzed marketing campaign effectiveness using Bayesian A/B testing in Python. Modeled conversion rates with PyMC, estimated posterior distributions, computed lift with credible intervals, and evaluated the probability of campaign success.

# Bayesian Inference Analysis for Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

## Description
This project evaluates the effectiveness of a marketing campaign using Bayesian A/B testing.
Pre- and post-campaign conversion rates are modeled using PyMC to estimate posterior
distributions, lift, credible intervals, and the probability of campaign success.

## Technologies
- Python
- PyMC
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Results
- Positive lift in post-campaign conversion rate
- High probability of campaign success
- Clear business insights using Bayesian inference
